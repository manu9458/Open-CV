# Industrial Grade Motion Monitoring System

This project is a modular, high-performance motion detection system using OpenCV.

## Key Features

*   **Real-time Person Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv8 for accurate human detection.
*   **PPE Compliance Verification**: Detects and validates usage of safety helmets/hard hats.
*   **Restricted Zone Monitoring**: configurable virtual geofencing to alert on unauthorized access.
*   **Intelligent Alerting**: 
    *   Visual indicators (Green=Safe, Red=Violation).
    *   Telegram Integration for instant snapshot alerts to safety supervisors.
*   **Performance Optimized**: Threaded capture methodology to ensure high FPS execution.
*   **Robust Logging**: Detailed CSV logs of all safety violations and system events.
*   **Environment Ready**: Configurable for both Development and Production environments.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.9 or higher
*   Webcam or IP Camera source

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/industrial-safety-monitor.git
cd industrial-safety-monitor
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```ini
# Environment (development / production)
APP_ENV=development

# Telegram Alerts (Optional)
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id_here
```

## Usage

Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

*   **To Exit**: Press `Q` or `ESC`.

## Logic & Thresholds

*   **Violations**: An alert is triggered if a person is detected without a helmet OR entering the restricted zone.
*   **Alert Cooldown**: Alerts are throttled (configurable in `src/config/settings.py`) to prevent spamming.
*   **Confidence**:
    *   Development: Lower thresholds (40-50%) for easier testing.
    *   Production: Higher thresholds (60-70%) for reliability.
